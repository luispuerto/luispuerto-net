Minimal Mistakes has been developed to be 100% compatible with GitHub Pages hosting. To get up and running with a new GitHub repository following these steps.

1. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork) and then rename the repo to **_USERNAME_.github.io**
2. Clone your new repo with `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME.git`
3. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) and theme dependencies with `bundle install`.
4. Customize configuration, data files, and publish your first post.

If you're hosting several Jekyll based sites under the same GitHub username you will have to use Project Pages instead of User Pages. Essentially you rename the repo to something other than **yourgithubusername.github.io** and use the `gh-pages` branch instead of `master`. For more details check [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).
