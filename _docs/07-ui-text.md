Text found various UI elements, `_layouts`, and `_includes` have all been grouped together as a set of translation keys. This is by no means a full-on i18n solution, but it does help make customizing things a bit easier.

Currently all of the keys in `_data/ui-text.yml` are English only. If you're are interested in localizing for other languages feel free to submit pull-requests and I will be happy to look the over and merge in.

Many of the label based keys like `meta_label`, `categories_label`, `tags_label`, `share_on_label`, `follow_label`, and more can be left blank if you'd like to omit them. It really depends on you and if you want an even more minimal look to your site.
