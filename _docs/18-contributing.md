Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug]({{ site.gh_repo }}/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue]({{ site.gh_repo }}/issues/new) or [pull request]({{ site.gh_repo }}/compare). If this is your first pull request, it may help to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

As the theme's name implies I'd like to keep it as minimal as possible. It has been designed as a base for you to build off of.

Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask :smile:.
