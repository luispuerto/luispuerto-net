My name is Luis Puerto and I'm from **[Ponferrada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponferrada)**, a medium size town in the [Green Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Spain) :es:, in **[Northwest of the country](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ponferrada,+Le%C3%B3n,+Spain/@41.9308893,-7.7021,7.93z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd30ba8c4ef7b633:0xdc636ce1ab239060!8m2!3d42.5499958!4d-6.598259?hl=en)** and the main city of [El Bierzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bierzo) county. El Bierzo, is a [small region](http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/10/07/inenglish/1475851411_631393.html) formed basically for a valley ending in Galicia and surrounded by Asturias and León.

There, I spent the first 30 years of my life and I went to [high school](http://www.iesgilycarrasco.com) and college at [University of León](https://www.unileon.es), where I got a **Degree in [Forestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry) and Environmental Engineering.**

In the last years of my studies and after I got my degree, I worked in different forestry related projects around my region, where I got experience in **GIS, GPS, forest management and inventory.** Later, I landed in a non-profict organization related to the Spanish government, whose aims were related to the development El Bierzo, CO2 capture technologies and the Energy Museum. I was there for almost 4 years working in different positions, doing incredible different tasks and getting a great experience. I learned how **a big organization works, how to manage big projects and budgets, I polished my cartographic skills and I got experience managing teams.** I started as a responsible of field work for a research project related to **chestnut tree blight** and ended as responsible of the **technology and innovation** area.

After that, I decided look for an international career and moved to Umeå, Sweden :sweden:. I was living there for 6 months enjoying the Swedish life and people, being a little *Skogstokig*, learning a little bit of Swedish (*jaaahhaa!!*) and about fire management in the North or Europe. Finally, I enrolled in the [iGEON master](http://www.igeon.eu) about **GIS and remote sensing**, from Lund University. Then, my SO decided to move to Joensuu, Finland :finland:; for professional reasons where we've been living for more than 3 years (yes, it's cold!, but only with the wrong clothing). There, I had the opportunity to learn Finnish (*minä puhun vähän suomea*), enjoy Finnish forest and sauna, learn a little bit of cross-country skiing and discover Finnish people and their silence.

My main areas of interest are, as you could guess for my background, **forestry** and **engineering** although I'm also interested in **science** and **technology** in general. I'm a really curious person and I'm usually interested in everything. While I was in Finland, I have the opportunity to learn and explore about **remote sensing, LiDAR, biomass and research**, and my current ongoing projects are related to those areas, while I finish my master. Recently, I also discover my interesest about **statistics** (I always hate them) and more specific about the **[RStats](https://www.r-project.org)**, **[data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)** and **[data visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization)** fields (long life to [Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/)). Perhaps, for the influence of the people I have around (thanks!) and my fair-good relation with computers. Also, perhaps, because for me is a way to squeeze data and see the "hidden truth". Finally, I interested in **[big data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)**, **[nanocomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocomputer)** and new ways to get data.

Above all of that and in more personal setting, I really like the **outdoors** and I'm always ready to **explore** and **camp in the wilderness**. I'm interested in wide spectrum of **music**, **photography** and **[movies](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur19338098/ratings?sort=ratings_date%3Adesc&view=detail&start=1)** too. For a while, I was doing a little bit of **horseback riding** and **archery**. During my stay in Finland, I developed an acute interest in **baking bread and pizza**, mainly because for us was difficult to find Spanish style (hard crust) bread there and I learned using [Ken's book](http://kensartisan.com) (I was recently in his bakery [recently in his bakery](https://www.instagram.com/p/BS6vNqLgML3/) and I have to say it was a delicious experience).

Other fields that call my attention are, politics, [globalization and internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization) (in the human sense) and work management and organization (mainly through the [Fifth Discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline)). **Astronomy** and **space exploration** are of my interest too. And of course, **history**, as a way to learn from others experience.

On a final note, I've been also trying to improve my concentration through meditation, but the nirvana is something difficult to reach (*damn!*). I dream with **learning to fly** and to **sail** someday.
