My name is Luis Puerto and I'm from **[Ponferrada][]**, a medium-size town in the [Green Spain][GreenSpain] :es:, in the **[Northwest of the country][NorthwestOfTheCountry]** and the main city of [El Bierzo][ElBierzo] county. El Bierzo, is a [small region][SmallRegion] formed basically for a big valley ending in [Galicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)) and surrounded by [Asturias][] and the rest of [León][] province.

There, I spent the first 30 years of my life. I went to [high school][HighSchool] and college at [University of León][UniversityOfLeón], where I got a **Degree in [Forestry][] and Environmental Engineering.**

In the last years of my studies, and after I got my degree, I worked in different forestry related projects around my region, where I got experience in **GIS, GPS, forest management and inventory.** Later, I landed in a non-profict organization created by the [Spanish Central Government][SpanishCentralGovernment], whose aims were related to the development El Bierzo, CO2 capture technologies and the Energy Museum. I was there for almost 4 years working in different positions, doing incredible different tasks and getting a great experience. I learned how **a big organization works, how to manage big projects and budgets, I polished my cartographic skills and I got experience managing teams.** I started as a responsible of field work for a research project related to **chestnut tree blight** and ended as responsible of the **technology and innovation** area.

After that, I decided look for an international career and moved to Umeå, Sweden :sweden:. I was living there for 6 months enjoying the Swedish life and people, being a little *Skogstokig*, learning a little bit of Swedish (*jaaahhaa!!*) and about fire management in the North or Europe. Finally, I enrolled in the [iGEON master][IgeonMaster] about **GIS and remote sensing**, from Lund University. Then, my SO decided to move to Joensuu, Finland :finland:; for professional reasons where we've been living since the beginning of 2014 (yes, it's cold!, but only with the wrong clothing). There, I had the opportunity to learn Finnish (*minä puhun vähän suomea*), enjoy Finnish forest and sauna, learn a little bit of cross-country skiing and discover Finnish people and their silence.

My main areas of interest are, as you could guess for my background, **forestry** and **engineering** although I'm also interested in **science** and **technology** in general. I'm a really curious person and I'm usually interested in everything. While I was in Finland, I have the opportunity to learn and explore about **remote sensing, LiDAR, biomass and research**, and my current ongoing projects are related to those areas, while I finish my master. Recently, I also discover my interesest about **statistics** (I always hated them) and more specific about the **[RStats][]**, **[data science][DataScience]** and **[data visualization][DataVisualization]** fields (long life to [Tufte][]). Perhaps, for the influence of the people I have around (thanks!) and my fair-good relation with computers. Also, maybe, because for me is a way to squeeze data and see the "hidden truth". Finally, I interested in **[big data analysis][BigDataAnalysis]**, **[nanocomputing][]** and new ways to get data.

Above all of that and in more personal setting, I really like the **outdoors** and I'm always ready to **explore** and **camp in the wilderness**. I'm interested in wide spectrum of **music**, **photography** and **[movies][]** too. For a while, I was doing a little bit of **horseback riding** and **archery**. When I arrived to Finland, I developed an acute interest in **baking bread and pizza**, mainly because for us was difficult to find Spanish style (hard crust) bread there and I learned using [Ken's book][Ken'sBook] (I was [recently in his bakery][RecentlyInHisBakery] and I have to say it was a delicious experience).

Other fields that call my attention are, politics, [globalization and internationalization][GlobalizationAndInternationalization] (in the human sense) and work management and organization (mainly through the [Fifth Discipline][FifthDiscipline]). **Astronomy** and **space exploration** are of my interest too. And of course, **history**, as a way to learn from others experience.

On a final note, I've been also trying to improve my concentration through meditation, but the nirvana is something difficult to reach (*damn!*). I dream with **learning to fly** and to **sail** someday soon.
