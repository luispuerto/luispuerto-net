The full content of the site is copyrighted to its authors unless it's stayed otherwise. The main author of this site is [Luis Puerto][]. However, both the content and the code are license under open source and creative commons permissive licenses. 

The code and the content have different kind of licenses because they are different kind of _animals_ and usually a license that is suitable to for a piece of software —code— is not going to be suitable for other kinds of intellectual property, like text, photos or other media. You can learn a little bit about the rational [here][no-soft-li]. 

## The code

{% include figure image_path="assets/images/pages/MIT.png" alt="MIT license logo" caption="MIT license logo" %}{: style="max-width: 400px" .align-left}

The code, unless it's stated otherwise, is licensed in the same way as the creator of the template released it, so all my changes and additions are licensed also with a [**MIT license**][mit]. 

If you want to know more about the MIT license you just can visit the [Open Source Initiative Website][os] and read the [full text of the license][mit]. The customized license for this site can be read [here][mit-gh]. 

To sum it up a little bit, it's a really permissive license that allow you to do anything you want with the code and, as usual, doesn't give you any warranty about it. You can also visit [choosealicense.com][] that offers good summaries of the licenses for code. 

### Additional code

There are other pieces of code that make this system work and each of them have their own license. You can check the license of each of those pieces of software in [here][L4C].
