## Profile

Hi, my name is Luis Puerto and I’m a dynamic and versatile Forest Engineer from Spain with more than 10 years of diverse and wide experience in GIS, remote sensing and data analysis. I have been working lately on projects involving LiDAR, biomass, coding —specially in R— and trade data. I have experience working internationally, with a wide range of technologies and in interdisciplinary teams. I have great ability to learn and an analytical mind. I am looking for challenging projects where I can use my background and skills while learning new ones in the process.
