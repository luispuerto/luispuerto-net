## Profile

I’m a dynamic and versatile engineer from Spain with more than 15 years of international experience in data science and analysis, GIS, and remote sensing. Lately, I deep dive into sustainability where I’ve helped companies to reduce their emissions and be aware of the threats of climate change. Also, I’ve worked on projects related to LiDAR, satellite data, biomass, carbon accounting, land use change, and trade, with special emphasis on R and Python coding. I’m always interested in learning new skills and I’m looking for challenging projects where I can put my background and skills to good use.
