## Profile

I’m a dynamic and versatile engineer from Spain with more than 15 years of experience on data science and analysis, GIS, and remote sensing. Lately, I’ve been working on projects related to LiDAR, biomass, and trade data with special emphasis on R coding. I have experience working internationally, with a wide range of technologies and in interdisciplinary teams. I’m always interested in learning new skills and I’m looking for challenging projects where I can put to good use my background and skills.

- Produced and developed statistical models to yield biomass estimations.  
- Wrote and published a scientific paper on biomass, LiDAR and multispectral sensors. 
- Cut [R-analysis][R] computing-time from days to hours using parallel [computing on cloud][AWS].

- Developed two paper regional tourist maps and successfully served the organization’s GIS needs like assist on cartography matters or data analysis. 
- Delivered GIS training for inhouse staff and for the general public.  
- Led [scientific study’s][CastaneaProject] fieldwork: inventory operations, data processing and analysis. 

## Additional Noteworthy Experience

On **2006** I started to work as a **freelance consultant** in Spain where I collaborated with companies like  [Tecnosylva][] or [TRAGSATEC][], for private individuals and for small and big municipalities, like Ponferrada Municipality. I participate in small and big projects like the “Preliminary plan for the Pajariel Forestry Park” in [Ponferrada][], “Integral Management of the Ponferrada’s Mountains,” or the “Inventory of Forest Roads in Laciana”. Some of my main activities and accomplishes were: 

- Successfully delivered reports that were essential to defend an environmental project public town-hall meetings. 
- Advised and produced insights about citizen participation on environmental projects. 
- Lead teams to collect data on the field on thousands of hectares using PDA, Vertex, and electronic caliper.
