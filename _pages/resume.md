## Profile and Objective

I am a dynamic and versatile Forest Engineer from Spain with more than 10 years of diverse and wide experience in GIS, remote sensing and data analysis. I have been working lately on research projects involving LiDAR, biomass and R language. I have experience working internationally, in different fields related to technology and interdisciplinary teams. I have great ability to learn, and I have an analytical mind. I am mainly looking for challenging projects related to GIS, remote sensing technologies and new ways to acquire data where I can use my background and skills, learning new ones in the process.
