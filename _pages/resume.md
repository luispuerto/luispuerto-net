## Profile and Objective

I am a dynamic and versatile Forest Engineer from Spain with more than
10 years of diverse and wide experience in GIS and remote sensing. I have been
working lately on research projects involving LiDAR, biomass and R language. I
have experience working internationally, in different fields related to
technology and interdisciplinary teams. I have great ability to learn, and I
have an analytical mind. I am mainly looking for challenging projects related
to GIS, remote sensing technologies and new ways to acquire data where I can
use my background and skills, learning new ones in the process.
