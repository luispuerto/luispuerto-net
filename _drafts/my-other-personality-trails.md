I've been trying to dissect my results in the 16personalities test about [my personality](/archive/tags/my-personality/) in previous posts and I would like to continue, and finish talking about how they think my [big 5 trails are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits). 

As you can see in the picture in the left. They think I have: 

- **Mind:** Extraverted (78%) vs. introverted (22%). 
- **Energy:** Observant (58%) vs. intuitive (42%). 
- **Nature:** Thinking (53%) vs. feeling (47%). 
- **Tactics:** Prospecting (51%) vs. judging (49%). 
- **Identity:** Assertive (76%) vs. turbulent (24%). 

I would like to talk a little bit about each of the trails and see how I really fit —or I think I fit— on those results. 

## Mind: Extraverted vs. Introverted

In their opinion, I'm extraverted (78%) vs. introverted (22%), which means I'm a highly extraverted person. However, we shouldn't confuse 

I really, don't consider me that way at all, and I've always consider myself more introverted than extroverted. However, compare with what and whom am I more extroverted? As a Spaniard, I'm provably mostly introverted as a person —or I tend to be. However, in the North of Europe and in the Nordics I'm probably seen as an extroverted person. 

[They say](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted) that extroverts *are not as sensitive to outer stimuli and need to seek them out in order to gain a kind of functional equilibrium and to perform well*. Well, it's true that I like strong sensations because they make me feel alive, but I can usually appreciate the quiet and solitude. 

They also say that usually extraverted people aren't really afraid of engaging with their environment and surroundings. They aren't afraid to take the lead, and challenge others and themselves. And I have mixed feeling about that, because of course I'm afraid of if need to take to lead —I'm scared to dead. Who wouldn't?— but in the same I don't think I would feel uncomfortable in that role. 

> Introverts are more likely to dislike coffee and energy drinks. 

Are most of Finnish people extraverted because they love caffeine? I doubt it. 

## Energy: Observant vs. Intuitive

It seems that I'm in between two worlds here... and more or less it's true in my opinion. I really think this has a really positive side.
