[A couple of posts ago](/blog/2018/05/21/16-personalities-apparently-im-an-entrepreneur/) —or perhaps a little bit more— I was briefly explaining about the results of a personality test I took while attending a course in Finland. In that *test* they told me I have a personality with a role of [Explorer](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/roles-explorers) and a strategy of [People Mastery](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/strategies-people-mastery). The role *determines our goals, interests and preferred activities* and the strategy *shows our preferred ways of doing things and achieving goals*. I would like to explore —if you excuse me the repetition— a little bit more those features of my personality and discuss a little bit more if they are accurate.

## Role: Explorer

Let's begin saying that I've always consider myself an explorer. I like to wander and discover new things, and always yearn to find and arrive to places where no one was before or they have been seldom visited. Of course, this is something that in our time and place is really difficult —unless you start looking to other planets— because although there are still really remote areas in our planet we can confidently say that humankind has reached to all places around the glove, even the most remote and extreme, if not physically, through satellite images. 

However, it seems that explorer have more connotations than just explore, and if I take a look to the [explorer role in the 16 personalities site](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/roles-explorers) I come across things that I think are mostly true, with some exceptions —of course all the good things are true and all the bad are false :grimacing:. These are the ones I really thing represent myself.  

### Uncertainty & quick thinking

It's true that I'm really confortable with uncertainty, but I also really like to plan ahead and usually before I being to walk I have more or less a clear picture of where I want to arrive. Perhaps I really don't know how to reach there or what is exactly the way but more or less I like to have an idea. I also find sometimes boring prepare too much for something. I like to be prepare, and I consider myself always prepare —if I go to the fiel I usually always carry with me a flashlight, even when I just going in the morning, you never know what is going to happen. 

It's also true that I'm think quick and as a good Spaniard I'm not afraid of improvisation. You always have to adapt to the circumstances you are going to come across, even when they aren't the best. But, again it's always nice to have something in mind before hand and a *plan b* just in case. 

### Gadgets & persuasion

It's true that I love gadgets, complements and tools, if they are useful, or course. And when I find something I like I really want to squeeze all the juice of it. In other words, I really like to learn how really operate it. 

About persuasion, I really don't know, when I really want something, I really want it, and I don't stop till I have it. It could seem that I've stopped sometimes, but usually there is some craving underlying somewhere.  

### Monotony, quitting & obligations

Well, who isn't bored by monotony? I think that everyone like some changes from time to time. However, it's true that I really need them, and at least form time to time I need to have some adventure to feel that I'm alive. I think that is the reason I like to travel a lot, meet new people and find new things. 

About quitting, well, it's more or less true, but I really think that life is like investing, if something isn't really working, it's better quit, take your losings and try to find a more fruitful investment. There is nothing bad into quit from something that you really don't see any future, unless you take quitting as the norm, which I don't. 

In relation to obligations. I don't know, don't you feel that when something is *mandatory* it loses the appeal? There is a Galician saying that you can more or less translate to English like *one always want what one can't have*, in other words, *grass is always greener in neighbors' lawn*. Obligations are sometimes like that, you but to do them, so they become less fun, even when they are. Anyway, I understand that what have to be done, must be done, thus, it'll be done. 

### Relaxed, freedom-loving & spontaneous

Is someone out there that like to be stressed? Yeah, it's true, I'm relaxed and I really like to be casual, but that doesn't mean that I'm like to be lazy, careless or nothing similar. I just really think that when things aren't taken too seriously you can manage them better —and usually you'll end up seeming something closer to reality. And this is something that I also apply to myself —and I hope others too— I don't like to take myself too seriously and I hate then other people take themselves too seriously. Life is a tragicomedy —now that I think about it this is an angle really typical in the South of Europe, where we are really used to laugh to ourselves. 

Other reason to be relaxed is, the social side of life. Then things are really serious they get stiff and when they get stiff the social component is usually lost. The social components, whether you like it or not, is the glue that make us stay together and in the end work together. In the past we could work alone, but nowadays it's just impossible. Teamwork is a must. 

However, I like freedom, and I love that others have also freedom. Specially in relations. I like that relations really flow in a natural way and I don't like to force anything. I like to work in relations, if necessary, and any work relation need to be work out. Friendship is like a plant, if you don't water it —even from time to time— it usually ends dying. That freedom make me don't care what others think about me —unless it's someone I have in high regard— 

As I said before, I'm not afraid of improvisation and for that reason I really think I don't mind to be spontaneous —but not incredible spontaneous, don't think I'm jumping around all the time. I also know when I have to adapt to the environment and when I have to adapt the environment to my needs.

Finally, I know that I have problems sometimes with what in psicology is called *[delayed gratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification)* —or at least I think I have— but I know that the perfect way to deal with it is make goals smaller and more reachable. In other words, chop those big tasks in more and more reachable ones, that are easy to manage. 

## Strategy: People Mastery

 I'm really surprised that they have suggested that I have a strategy related to people and even more surprised that this has to do anything with any *mastery*. I've been always quite shy and my mom was always *pushing* me to interact with people. In other words, I'm not afraid of people, but for a Spaniard perhaps I'm socially average. I've come across in my life with people much more social than me. 

Nevertheless, reading [the description of people mastery strategy in 16 personalities site](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/strategies-people-mastery), I, again, find things that I would identify with my personality. But again, only the good ones, of course :grimacing:. 

### Stress resistant

Well, I really don't know about that and I would be really lying if I say I'm just *stress proof*. What is more, as I say before, I usually a relaxed person. It's true that If I'm stressed, it's something I'm not easily show off for several reasons. First of all because stress brings stress and even more if you show your stress your environment —a.k.a. other people— is going to get stressed so you end in a stress vicious circle. Everyone, has a breaking point, we are humans after all. I think that more than once I've been close to that point but I finally manage to return to safely from that trip. 

I'm also far away to be fearless when I engage with people, however, I really think that John Wayne was quite right —*[courage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway](https://johnwayne.com/quotes/)*. Everybody has *fear* when they deal with other people, even more if they don't know each other. How you manage that fear is what matters. Experience is also really important. 

### Traveling

I have to recognize, I love traveling, but traveling I don't like tourism. And I make the distinction that traveling is mixing up and trying to get the most of the place you are visiting. This rarely is possible to archive if you aren't in the place more than 15 days... Tourism is just visiting places for the sake of visiting. As much places you see the better. Quantity vs. quality. 

My favorite word is **try**. I love try new things to be able to have an opinion about that, even is this is just superficial in the beginning. I like to try food, to see and experience things and to know more about cultures form their own members. 

### Confidence

Confidence is something that one doesn't ever have enough. There isn't such thing as too much confidence. 

Now, in all seriousness, confidence is something that in some situations is better to have even when you aren't really sure about that you are doing. Confidence, sadly, is a currency that most of the people keep in high regard when they perceive it in other people, while the dubious is seem as weak. Something that is no bueno. 

This is a characteristic that I really don't know if I have always right, but I hope that due to experience I can improve. 

### Charisma & cooperation

I really don't know if I'm charismatic or not, but I don't consider I have charisma —someone that considers themselves to have charisma would be quite narcissist. However, I can be quite boisterous sometimes as any Spaniard out there in the wild. About talking and listening, I don't know, depending with what you are comparing me. I really like to listen if what people is saying is interesting. I also think that most of the people usually don't truly listen to other people, and this is really problematic. About talking... I don't know if I'm really talkative. If I have something to say about a topic I'll tell it for sure and I'll try to explain myself as much and clear as possible, something I not always achieve. 

I love cooperation and I really think that in humans is more natural than competition. We can have and should have both characteristics and competition has helped us to muster up our capabilities, but at the end of the day, we always going to need to cooperate —with our team, with our workmates, friends, family, etc— to be able to compete with others. Competition isn't always needed. 

I never ever have found that any part of my ego is at stake when I'm talking or having a disagreement with anyone. I guess that I have ego somewhere else, like everyone else, but in general I don't carry it with me. And it's true that I like to reach agreements and I'm always think that in any disagreement there is a way to find a solution that more or less satisfy to everyone involved. 

In general I don't have or hold any grievance, resentment, grudge or anything like that... I think that at some point in my life I came across people has acted with bad faith towards me, or have taken decisions against me or my feeling. I believe that most of the time isn't the person who is at fault but the system. 

And yeah, I'm probably socially idealistic and also realistic because one has to *[be realistic and demant the impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1968_events_in_France#Slogans_and_graffiti)*. Putting aside revolutionary slogans, as good engineer, I'm also wondering how something can be improve and operate more efficiently, society isn't an exception. 

### Leadership

I don't consider myself a natural leader or nothing of the sort, but I'm not afraid of leadership if I have to assume it —*[the punishment which the wise suffer who refuse to take part in the government, is to live under the government of worse men](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)#Book_I)*[^1]. Something that has happened to me couple of times in my life. I also think that to be a leader you don't have to be a leading position. Everyone is the leader of their own life and master of their own fate —*[I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus)*. Anyhow, I know that there are people much more capable to lead than me out there and I'm not afraid of get behind them if I have to. 

Leadership is quite a fuzzy term and much of a buzz work in business circles. Sadly, leaders are sometimes mistakenly associated just with executive positions and to be in *command*. Yet, leadership has more to do with [empower others than with command others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68unIDHgWhY) and bring people from personal visions to share visions of the future. 





[^1]: I know that isn't the original quote from [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) —[*That is perhaps why to seek office oneself and not await compulsion is thought disgraceful. But the chief penalty is to be governed by someone worse1 if a man will not himself hold office and rule. It is from fear of this, as it appears to me, that the better sort hold office when they do, and then they go to it not in the expectation of enjoyment nor as to a good thing,2 but as to a necessary evil and because they are unable to turn it over to better men than themselves*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0168:book=1:section=347c)— but I think [Emerson](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson) put much better himself.
