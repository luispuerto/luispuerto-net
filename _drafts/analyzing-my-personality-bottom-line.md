This is just the final post of the series about [my personality](/archive/tags/my-personality). It's been quite fun, but really hard, analyzing myself —or try to— from the starting point of the [16pernalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) test. I wanted to write the *final conclusion* as a separate post mainly because I want it to encroach all the other three post and I don't think this bit really fit at the bottom of any of the others, even when It's going to be small. 

The main reason I've done this exercise —analyze myself— is **improvement**. If one doesn't know well oneself, how one can really improve and try to be e better version of oneself? First time I read the test I really thought that it was more or less shenanigans. And more or less I still hold that opinion, since no test is going to give you, ever, a real picture of yourself.

However, I thought that it was probably a great tool to know myself better and to walk me through myself. Whether the test is really accurate in framing your personality, it create a interesting template or structure to dip you deeper into yourself. I never thought before in some of the points that the description of my personality raised and of course I never thought in evaluating them. So I really think it's worth it. 

The second great reason is **sharing**. I really wanted to share my personality with the rest of the world. Not because I really think I'm that important to anyone give a damn about how my personality is, but as an exercise of openness. Usually, when someone talks about us, and they are accurate, we get concerned, angry, mad at them and try to hide as soon as possible. In my opinion that is a perfectly natural behavior, but it has to change, even more if that description isn't done with malice. Trying to understand others and make it easy to understand us make us a better humans. Trying to find out what are the views of others and why and how they reached them it's a much better start a dialoge, instead of just fighting those views when they aren't close to ours. Sharing what are you and how are you see the world, it's a really good place to start. 

Sharing your flaws doesn't expose you others, just make you a better and probably more hones person. Let's try to find out about each other more often, so we can understand each other better, work better, live better.
