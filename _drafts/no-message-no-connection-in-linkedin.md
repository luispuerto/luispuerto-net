I think this is something that almost anyone with a LinkedIn account has suffered or happened to them... an invitation to connect that comes out of the blue from someone you don't know. No message, or just the standard message, no explanation, nothing... just an invitation in your LinkedIn inbox from someone, usually with a happy face —maybe a fake one— that perhaps work in a similar field as you do —or not— and they live close to you —or they don't. **I hate it**. 

What are they? Are they bots? Are they mining personal information? Are they just people that can figure out how social interactions should work? Did they click in my profile by mistake? What is going on here? A really don't understand :confused:.

Ok… after a brief search on internet about the topic, now I understand. They are [LIONs](http://greenbuzzagency.com/what-is-a-lion-on-linkedin-2/)[^1] —*LinkedIn Open Networkers*— in other words they are people what their only goal is to grow their LinkedIn's network, so it's easier for them to connect to other people in the future and appear in more people's searchs. If you have a vast network of people you have more chances of having just one or two degrees of separation with anyone that you are **really** interested to connect with and you are going to to show up in more searchers because you are just one or two degrees of separation from them. You can find longest explanation [here](https://topdogsocialmedia.com/why-i-dont-connect-with-lions-on-linkedin/) and [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-you-receive-random-LinkedIn-invitations). 

**Don't get me wrong. I'm nothing special**, just a professional looking for opportunities and someone who is, of course, really glad to meet and connect with people. I think LinkedIn could be a great place to do it. The problem is that you just don't poke, or connect, people randomly without knowing anything about them, without telling them why do you want to know more about them and/or telling a little bit about you. If you sent me a message telling me why you want to connect with me —just a line, or a couple if you want— then I will be more than happy to connect with you. On the condition that you have a real a meaningful reason because you want to connect. If you send me the standard message or you tell me that you *just want to connect*, it has the same effect as it you tell me nothing. 

Can you imagine that you are in a bar, a conference or just in the street and you decide to give your business card to random people and passersby? With no reason at all? Telling to all of them the same artificial phrase without trying to learn anything about them. Would you take their card? Would you keep they card? No I guess no, because it doesn't have any sense unless you are just *selling something* and giving handouts to everyone without any filter that most probably will end up in the garbage. What are you selling? Aren't you a seasoned professional that you really want to stand out other the rest? Don't you really want to look professional?

On the other hand, just imagine for a second. You are in the same bar, conference or just in the street (in some event or something) and someone approach you, introduce himself, tell you that knows you from this and that, and they would love to know more about your work and they hand to you their card, I'm sure your perspective changes a lot about that person and you are provably going to remember them. 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/blog/2019/LInkedIn-recomendations.png" alt="LinkedIn recommendations" caption="This is the problem, the LinkedIn recommendations panel" %}{: .align-right style="width: 40%"}

The problem seems to be related to the *Recommended for you* panel on *[My Network](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people%3BI1%2BtgQBtQf%2BCV%2BK1F7uGrA%3D%3D)* section. If you click on one of those connect buttons seems that a direct invitation to connect is sent to that profile without asking you if you want to add a note. I'm wondering now if this *isn't a bug, but a feature*. In other words, does Microsoft want you to have as connections as possible? 

I don't care what are the current LinkedIn dynamics, or if they have changed since Microsoft has bought it. In my opinion it's plainly wrong to send invitations to connected to people you don't know out of the blue and without any message. Instead of just click on that connect button in *[My Network](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people%3BI1%2BtgQBtQf%2BCV%2BK1F7uGrA%3D%3D)* section, you can check the profile of the person LinkedIn is suggesting you and in their profile you can click on connect —if you consider the person is worth to connect with— and add a note to your invitation to connect from there. Even if I know you beforehand, in real life or just because we've been exchanging emails —or whatever— you should add a note to refresh my memory. Memories fail! 

As [this guy states](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/4-reasons-accept-every-random-linkedin-invitation-john-buckley/), if you don't add a message to your invitation you are showing: 

1. That you are **indistinguishable** of all the other invitations. 
2. You are **disingenuous**, that I'm going to include you in my network just because you send me an invitation. 
3. You lack of **creativity** and you are **lazy** since you decided not to even check my profile —and contact me from there— and if you have done so, you decided explicitly not to write a note. 

The problem is aggravated by LinkedIn since you can't ask to someone that is asking you to connect with exactly they want to connect with you, since that is a *premium* :money_mouth_face: feature. So people don't want to pay, which is normal with that [prices](https://www.linkedin.com/comm/premium/products?family=jss&trk=pre_hub_b_upgrade), and just try to connect with others in the free tier. 

I know that send a message, check the profile or research a little bit sometimes is a lot of effort, but I really think it worth it. I have this web where you can [contact](/contact) me in several different ways and I can also have my contact information in my LinkedIn profile. There is no excuse to send me a message. 

**NO MORE RANDOM INVITATIONS, please!**

[^1]: To be honest, and after giving it a thought, I don't think they are even that, because I bet an arm that most of them don't know what a LION is. I didn't know until I wrote this piece and I doubt most people in LinkedIn know about that. They just connect because they know they are going to get something on the long run.
