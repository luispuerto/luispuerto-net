I think this is something that almost anyone with a LinkedIn account has suffered or happened to them... and invitation to connect from someone that you don't know out of the blue. No message, no explanation, nothing... just an invitation in your LinkedIn inbox from someone that perhaps work in a similar field as you do —or not— and they live close to you —or they don't. I hate it. 

Don't get me wrong. I'm nothing special, just a professional looking for opportunities and that of course it's really glad to meet people and I think that LinkedIn is a great place to do it. The problem is that you just don't poke, or connect, people randomly without knowing anything it about them. 

If you are able why want to connect with —just a line, or a couple if you want— when I will be more than happy to connect with you. 

Can you imagine that you are in a bar, a conference or just in the street and you decide to give your business card to random people and passersby? No I guess no, because you are also a seasoned professional and you don't want to seem that easy. You want to connect with people in a meaningful way.
