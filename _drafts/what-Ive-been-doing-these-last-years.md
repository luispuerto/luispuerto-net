Since some people has asked me this once in a while, I think it's going to be a good idea to write a *small*[^0] post about *what I've been doing this last years since I left Spain*. I think I'm going to give it the shape of an *informal resume / curriculum* where I'm going to talk, superficially, about each of the things I've been doing.

First of all, I really want do differentiate between quality and quantity time. [Quality time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_time) for me has, more or less, the meaning everyone gives to it on the English language. 

> **Quality time** (**QT**) is an informal reference to time spent with close family, partners or friends that is in some way important, special, productive or profitable. It is time that is set aside for paying full and undivided attention to the person or matter at hand. It may also refer to time spent **performing some favorite activity**.

I would add that for me it isn't only that but also time that I spend on myself... doing whatever I enjoy and I think it's going to be positive for me, even if it's in the long run. It's also those kind of activities that are really difficult to quantify, but they stand out for their quality. 

On the other hand, there is the quantity time concept, of which I couldn't find a formal definition, but I would define as all that other time that you can usually quantify doing something specific. Working, learning, volunteering... This is usually the kind of things that people put in their curriculums because they can be undoubtedly quantified —they can be weighted— so other people usually can take them into account. 

One of the earliest records of the term *quality time* we have, is an article in the [Annapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland), [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland) (United States) newspaper The Capital, in January 1973, in the article "How To Be Liberated" where the term *quality time* appeared opposed to *quantity time*: 

> The major goal of each of these role changes is to give a woman time to herself, Ms. Burton explained. "A woman's right and responsibility is to be self fulfilling," she said. She gives "quality time" rather than "quantity time" to each task, whether it be writing, cleaning the house or tending the children.

**Quality vs. Quantity**

What do you prefer to have? Quality or quantity in your life? It's pretty clear that if you could you would like to have both. However, you can't always have both.  

You also have to understand that since I discovered the ***Optimistic [Nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism)***[^1] *philosophy*, I'm a devoted follower of this way of understanding the universe.

> If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to **have fun and live as happy as possible**. Bonus points if you make the life of **other people** better. More bonus points if you help build a **Galactic Human Empire**.

## Quality Time

### Enjoying my life

This is first and foremost important thing I've been doing, **enjoying my life**, and I think you should too! We are clearly here to enjoy our life, not to suffer. I've been doing all the following things —and some others— and I've been enjoying them. No regrets. Perhaps some of the things haven't been as productive, as good, or didn't turn out as expected. However, in the end, all of them, have been positive because they've been part of this trip that is life, and I've learn from them. 

### Discovering & developing myself

Some of things I've been doing have been really positive for my personal development, I've been discovering part of myself that I didn't know till know and I've been even discovering my personality. All of these, help me to be e better person, better professional and be more productive. 

#### Learning

Part of that discovery and personal development are related to learning. Learning new skills, and learning that you can learn new skill. We are natural learners, but for some reason some people decide that they don't want to learn anymore. They end up stuck. 

##### Improving my English

All these time I've been improving my English since I've been living in an international environment and I've tried to travel as much I could —and still try. I've been living for almost 5 years in Finland, where almost all the time in my daily life I have to use English for communicating with others. Before coming to Finland I was living 6 months in Sweden where the same happen. During the period we've been living in Finland we moved for 5 month to the west coast of the United States where my English had an incredible boost. I tried to speak with people as much as possible and one my fondest memories is talking and discussing with our landlord and housemate for really long hours about the most diverse topics: politics, life, science, philosophy, Europe vs America, forestry, ecology, life... 

##### Learning other languages

Since I live in Finland, I've been learning Finnish and I am able to speak a little bit. Not enough to maintain a normal conversation for sure, but it has serve me well in a variety of situations when I've needed it. Learning Finnish, has been a really *interesting experience*. It's a different language family, so you usually have to start from scratch since you aren't going to have any reference or resemblance with your mother tongue —unless you are Estonian or Hungarian. In my particular case, my mother tongue is Spanish and pronunciation of Finnish isn't a *pain in the tongue*, but grammar is totally different. Besides of what painful has been learn the little Finnish I speak, it's been a really change of perspective on thinking. Languages are a way of thinking and Finnish is a really particular one, usually really concise.    

I've also leaned a little bit of Swedish while I lived in Sweden, which was much easier than Finnish, but I've almost forgotten all of it. I liked Swedish because it's a really nice language to listen, really rhythmic and even sometimes funny. 

##### Coding & computer skills

All these years I've been improving my computer stills a lot. I've been introducing to coding, and now I'm able to code in R, and beginning to code in other languages as Rubi, CSS, HTML or Liquid. Proof of that is this website that I've little by little changing from the original template to what you see it now to adjust to my necessities. I've even add new functionalities. 

I've been also learn to use Git, and I use almost everyday to keep track of my work, and also I've increase incredible the use of the shell and the command line. I've also write scripts on shell / command line from time to time when I need them, either to analyze LiDAR data using Fusion or to fulfill my necessities in macOS or Linux. 

I've been learning about Linux too, since I have a couple of Raspberry Pis which I use for different tasks at home, like have a VPN server, or NAS, audio server, VPN router... 

#### Reading

Reading is another way of learning about stuff, but usually in a more relaxing way —usually when you go to bed. In the last years I've been able to reconcile with reading and I've been able to increase the number of books I've been reading little by little. Internet it's great, but 

I've been increasing my readings and I plan to increase even more since little by little I find the internet more boring and I want to get back my concentration.

## Entanglement

Of course I don't have my life that extremely compartmentalized all of these and much more are entangle... mixed together as in any other life. Lives are organic and usually their parts can't be put in different boxes because they end up dying. 

## Is all of these just bull**it?

Perhaps... What it's true is we are usually much more of that we manage to show to the rest of the people, for good or bad.
