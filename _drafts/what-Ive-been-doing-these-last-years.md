Since some people has asked me this once in a while, I think it's going to be a good idea to write a *small*[^0] post about *what I've been doing these last years since I left Spain*. I think I'm going to give it the shape of an *informal resume / curriculum* where I'm going to talk, superficially, about each of the things I've been doing.

First of all, I really want do differentiate between quality and quantity time. [Quality time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_time) for me has, more or less, the meaning everyone gives to it on the English language. 

> **Quality time** (**QT**) is an informal reference to time spent with close family, partners or friends that is in some way important, special, productive or profitable. It is time that is set aside for paying full and undivided attention to the person or matter at hand. It may also refer to time spent **performing some favorite activity**.

I would add that for me it isn't only that but also time that I spend on myself... doing whatever I enjoy and I think it's going to be positive for me, even if it's in the long run. It's also those kind of activities that are really difficult to quantify, but they stand out for their quality. 

On the other hand, there is the quantity time concept, of which I couldn't find a formal definition, but I would define as all that other time that you can usually quantify —hours, days, weeks, months or years— doing something specific. Working, ~~learning~~ getting a diploma[^1], volunteering... This is usually the kind of things that people put in their curriculums because they can be undoubtedly quantified —they can be weighted— so other people usually can take them into account. 

**Quality vs. Quantity**  
{: .text-center .gigantic}

What do you prefer to have? Quality or quantity in your life? It's pretty clear that if you could, you would like to have both. However, you can't always have both.  

You also have to understand that since I learned about ***Optimistic [Nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism)***[^2] *philosophy*, I'm think this is the correct way to understand the universe.

> If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to **have fun and live as happy as possible**. Bonus points if you make the life of **other people** better. More bonus points if you help build a **Galactic Human Empire**.

## Quality Time

### Enjoying my life

This is first and foremost important thing I've been doing, **enjoying my life**, and I think **you should too!** We are clearly here to enjoy our life, not to suffer. I've been doing all the following things —and some others— and I've been enjoying them. No regrets. Perhaps some of the things haven't been as productive, as good, or didn't turn out as expected. However, in the end, all of them, have been positive because they've been part of this trip that is life, and I've learn from them. 

### Discovering & developing myself

Some things I've been doing have been really positive for my personal development, I've been discovering part of myself that I didn't know till now and I've been even discovering parts of my personality that I didn't know I have. All of these, help me to be e better person, better professional and be more productive. 

#### Learning

Part of that discovery and personal development are related to learning. Learning new skills, and learning that you can learn new skills. We are natural learners, but for some reason some people decide that they don't want to learn anymore. They end up stuck. 

##### Improving my English

All these time I've been improving my English since I've been living in an international environment and I've tried to travel as much I could —and still try. I've been living for almost 5 years in Finland, where almost all the time in my daily life I have to use English for communicating with others. Before coming to Finland I was living 6 months in Sweden where the same happened. During the period we've been living in Finland we moved for 5 month to the west coast of the United States where my English had an incredible boost. I tried to speak with people as much as possible —without weird anyone out— and one my fondest memories is talking and discussing with our landlord and housemate for really long hours about the most diverse topics: politics, life, science, philosophy, Europe vs America, forestry, ecology, life... 

##### Learning other languages

Since I live in Finland, I've been learning Finnish and I am able to speak a little bit. Not enough to maintain a normal and regular conversation for sure, but it has serve me well in a variety of situations when I've needed it. Learning Finnish, has been a really *interesting experience*. It's in different language family, so you usually have to start from scratch since you aren't going to have any reference or resemblance with your mother tongue —unless you are [Estonian, Hungarian or part of the small Fino-Ugric family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finno-Ugric_languages). In my particular case, my mother tongue is Spanish and pronunciation of Finnish isn't a *pain in the tongue*, more the other way around, but grammar is totally different. Besides of what painful has been learn the little Finnish I speak, it's been a really change of perspective on thinking. Languages are a way of thinking and Finnish is a really particular one, usually really concise.    

I've also leaned a little bit of Swedish while I lived in Sweden —which was much easier than Finnish— but I've almost forgotten all of it. I liked Swedish because it's a really nice language to listen, really rhythmic and even sometimes, funny. 

##### Coding & computer skills

All these years I've been improving my computer stills a lot. I've been introducing to coding, and now I'm able to code in R, and I'm beginning to code in other languages as Rubi, CSS, HTML or Liquid. Proof of that is this website that I've little by little changing from the original template to what you see it now to adjust to my necessities. I've even add new functionalities. 

I've been also learn to use Git, and I use it almost everyday to keep track of my work. Also, I've increase incredible the use of the shell and the command line, where I've also write scripts from time to time when I need them, either to analyze LiDAR data using Fusion —or any other software— or to fulfill my necessities in macOS or Linux. 

I've been learning about Linux too, since I have a couple of Raspberry Pis which I use for different tasks at home, like have a VPN server, or NAS, audio server, VPN router... or whatever it comes to my mind. 

#### Reading

Reading is another way of learning about stuff, but usually in a more relaxing way —usually when you are close to go to bed. In the last years I've been able to reconcile with reading and I've been able to increase the number of books I've been reading little by little. Internet it's great, but in my opinion sometimes, or most of the times, lacks the substance that books usually have. Returning to reading has improved my ability to concentrate, which was eroded by internet. In the last year, I as able to read read 7 books, but I've started the year strong and in the last month I read two. 

I've been increasing my readings and I plan to increase even more since little by little I find the internet more boring everyday. Perhaps, I'm getting old, or perhaps is it has lost its nobility. Don't get me wrong, I still spend a lot of time reading on the internet and it's still my primary source of fresh information. Nevertheless, I started to despise [Facebook](/archive/tags/facebook/) —and all its ecosystem— and most of the other *social networks*. I still use [Twitter](https://twitter.com) quite a lot, and I'm a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) fan, but they lack features and it's difficult to create quality content. 

##### The Fifth Discipline

One of books I read these last years is "[The Fifth Discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline)", an all-time classic of organizational management, and in some regards much more, since it can lead to a different view of the world. I discovered The Fifth Discipline thanks to the CEO of the last organization I was working in Spain. I really think it's a great book and of course an interesting way to see organizations and humans interactions. 

I begun to feel interest by management, organizational science and productivity also while I was in Spain. There I learned that you can have all the resources of the world to create whatever you want or do whatever you want, but if you don't have a good assembled and effective team, you aren't going to succeed. Team are made or people, not computers, office furniture, buildings, gadgets, or factories. Most managers doesn't understand this basic concept, people are the basic building blocks of their organization. Humans aren't a resource, but an investment. Senge really understand this and explain it much better than me. 

What is The Fifth Discipline? System Thinking, the ability of seeing the world in a systemic way. It integrated the other four: Personal mastery, Mental Models, Building a Shared Vision and Team Learning. I don't have the time here to explain any of them, and I really don't think it's the place. If you want to know more, I really recommend to read any of the [Senge's books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge#Publications). 

### Enjoying my life with the person I love

This perhaps is going to sound naïve, innocent or even foolish. I don't know, but it's what it's. My partner and I met each other more than 15 years ago in a lost corner of the middle-south of Spain. For 10 years we maintain a relation in the distance. It was a great relation, with its good and bad things, but it was on distance. When I decided to move to Sweden was also because I wanted to start a new life with her, living under the same root. We got lucky and she got her dream position as a researcher in Finland and we decided to move here. I somehow wanted to enjoy and take back part of the time we were apart in Spain and try to share as much time as I could with her. We've been partners for life and I hope we will continue this way till the end of our lives. I've been really happy to be able to share all this time with her and travel together to the far side of the world. What an adventure! 

### Traveling and discovering the World

What of the things I've been also a lot is traveling. No, I been doing tourism. I don't like that, I don't want to collect places on an album. I really want to have experiences and try to know the places I go as much as I can. I live to explore the terrain. I've been really blessed that I've been able to do it during this years. 

#### Around the Nordic Countries

As I've mentioned before, I've been living in Sweden and now I live in Finland, but I've in all the other Nordic Countries, but Iceland. When we moved to Finland and we knew that it was going to be permanent we decided to move my old Volkswagen Golf to where we live in Finland from Spain. We decided not to take any ferry and we crossed Denmark, Sweden from South to North and Finland from North to South till where we live. 

Besides we've been traveling all around for business or leisure all around the Nordics. We been in Lapland and in [North Cape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Cape_(Norway)) as well as the [Lofototen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofoten) islands and the North part of Norway, where we've been camping. We've camped also in [Urho Kekonen](https://www.nationalparks.fi/urhokekkonennp),  [Koli](https://www.nationalparks.fi/kolinp) and [Patvinsuo](http://www.nationalparks.fi/patvinsuonp) National Parks. And of course we've hiked all around North Karelia and visited other parts of Finland. I even has witness the moose hunting on a weekend trip to the North of Finland. 

#### Europe

As I mentioned previously, at some point we decided to move the my old Volkswagen from Spain to Finland, so we drive all across Europe in which 

#### USA

### Coming across of interesting people

### Coaching

### Volunteering

#### Cultural integration volunteering

## Entanglement

Of course I don't have my life that extremely compartmentalized all of these and much more are entangle... mixed together as in any other life. Lives are organic and usually their parts can't be put in different boxes because they end up dying. 

## Is all of these just bull**it?

Perhaps... What it's true is we are usually much more of that we manage to show to the rest of the people, for good or bad. 

 







[^0]: Both of us know that this post isn't going to be small.
[^1]: I don't think that getting a diploma —going to the university to get some degree of formal education— fully equated to **learning** and gather knowledge. I know a lot of people that has several diplomas, even PhDs but they barely know anything. 
[^2]: It's pretty clear Optimistic Nihilism isn't a real philosophical term but a casual lingo. But perhaps you can learn a little bit more about the term in this [answer in Quora](https://qr.ae/TUtwbA).
