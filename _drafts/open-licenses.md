**NOTICE:** First of all take into account that IANAL and if you really have doubts about how open licenses work you should, really should, seek advice with a lawyer, specially with one with expertise on Intelectual Property (IP).

I've been wanting to create this post for long time, but I've been a little bit busy, here and there and in consequence, I couldn't. Besides, it's a quite a hell of a topic, on which I don't have a lot of background and I have to use a lot of my common sense. However, it a topic where there is a lot of debate sometimes and where a lot of people —including me sometimes— don't have a clear picture of the issue. Mainly because, even the experts doesn't have it and in some cases this is court fodder. 

I this post I'll try to state about my opinion about the issue, specially regarding the licenses related to R and it's packages. 

For starters, I would like to state that I love open licenses and I really thing that when you are not using them you are loosing potential colaborations, specially in a clear way.
