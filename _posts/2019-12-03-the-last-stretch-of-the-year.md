I wanted to apologize, first to myself and then to you because I have this place a _little bit abandoned_, but it's because a really good reason. 

This year has been really full of thrilling surprises and trips and I, in my selfishness, I've been trying to get the most of all those experiences in first person, which make me pause from my blogging since the end of February. More than seven months ago. 

I don't want to tell too much about this year now because it's still a little bit of it —just one month— and is probably worth more to prepare a summary post of the year closer to the end of December with all the events that happened. 

I just want you to know that I'll try to blog as much as possible in this last stretch since a lot it happening and I have a lot to tell. 

See you around!
