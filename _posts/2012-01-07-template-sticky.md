This is a sticky post.

There are a few things to verify:

  * The sticky post should be distinctly recognizable in some way in comparison to normal posts.
  * They should show at the very top of the blog index page, even though they could be several posts back chronologically.
  * They should still show up again in their chronologically correct position in time, but without the sticky indicator.
