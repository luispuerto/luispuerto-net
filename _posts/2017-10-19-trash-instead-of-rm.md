I just discovered that there is a way to send files to the trash instead of just delete them using the shell and I think it's really useful when you don't want to totally discard something to the oblivion. I found out about this because I was working on the shell and I needed to remove some files to check if app could work without them. Move or rename them was an option, but I thought that perhaps there were a more efficient way to that and thought that send then the trash was the most efficient way, since from there they could be deleted forever or restored. think

I thought that perhaps the command `rm`    could have some flag or option that send the files or directories you wish to remove to the trash instead of delete immediately them. However, after read a little bit about the topic, I realized that use rm command is a bad idea and practice to send files to the trash.

You can read a little bit more about it [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42757/make-rm-move-to-trash) and [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/50844/how-to-move-files-to-trash-from-command-line), but to summarize a little bit, it's basically not safe. You can get use to use `rm`    to send thing to the trash and if for a moment you are on other computer or with other username you can delete things permanently.

For that reason you can install other commands like [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli), and in macOS you can also install [rmtrash](https://github.com/PhrozenByte/rmtrash). On macOS you can install both things using [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and in Linux with `apt-get`  .

```shell 
# On Mac you can install with Brew
$ brew install trash-cli
$ brew install rmtrash

# On linux you can install with apt-get
$ sudo apt-get install trash-cli
```

On the previous links about the commands you have all the options you can implement in both commands.

Happy _trashing_.

PS/ You have to be aware that the shell trash is not the same you can see in your desktop or at least I could find them there. Perhaps, further config is needed.
