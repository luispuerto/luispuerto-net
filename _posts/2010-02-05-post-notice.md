A notice displays information that explains nearby content. Often used to call attention to a particular detail.

When using Kramdown `{: .notice}` can be added after a sentence to assign the `.notice` to the `<p></p>` element.

{: .notice}

Want to wrap several paragraphs or other elements in a notice? Using Liquid to capture the content and then filter it with `markdownify` is a good way to go.

```html
{% raw %}{% capture notice-2 %}
### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}{% endraw %}

<div class="notice">{% raw %}{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}{% endraw %}</div>
```

{% capture notice-2 %}
### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-2 | markdownify }}
</div>

Or you could skip the capture and stick with straight HTML.

```html
<div class="notice">
  <h3>Message</h3>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>
```

<div class="notice">
  <h3>Message</h3>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>
