This is the readme of my Jekyll page. That I moved from Wordpress to Jekyll while keeping the basic structure and trying to improve the design.

I've used as a base [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) template created by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com). 

This is mainly a work in progress right now so expect some things being odd or not in place. You can check what I want to do in my [TODO](TODO.md) file. 

I would be really happy if my work can help others also to change their website.
