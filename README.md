This is the source code of my personal site [luispuerto.net][]. It's built using the [Jekyll][] and [Netlify][]. I use the [Minimal Mistakes][mmistakes-template] template from [Michael Rose][mmistakes-web] as a base and I've added some changes from my _own vintage_. Please feel free to fork my work since I would really happy to see that it helps others to build also their sites.  

<sub>**NB**: I've archived **my work** in this repo previous to October 27, 2018 [here][site-back]. You can know more about the reasons **why** I've done that in this [blog post](http://luispuerto.net/blog/2018/11/05/cutting-down-the-size-of-your-repo/).</span>

## Getting Started

You can get a copy of this repo running the following in your terminal: 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/luispuerto/luispuerto.net.git
```

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite to run this blog locally is to have Jekyll on your machine. 

```shell
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```

Of course to be able to run Jekyll you need to have several other things on your system, like Ruby :gem:. Please check the [Jekyll docs][JekyllDocs] for more info about prerequisites. 

## Built With

This site is build using the following software and services. 

- [Jekyll][] - The static website generator I'm using to build my side. 
- [Minimal Mistakes][mmistakes-template] - The Jekyll template I'm using. 
- [Netlify][] - Where I'm building and hosting my site. 
- [TravisCI][] - I'm performing some continuous integration tasks over here, like for example index the site for [Algolia][] when I build it from master.  

### Jekyll Plugins & Gems :gem:

Since I've not publishing the site on GitHub pages and I'm building this page by other means, I have the freedom of using additional plugins and more granular control over what plugins I use on this site. These are the most important gems I'm using, but you can check the complete list on my [gem file][gem file].

- [jekyll-algolia][] - I'm using [Algolia][] as a search engine on the site, so this gem comes in handy to index the site every time I push a new version to master.  
- [jekyll-archives][] - I use this gem to create the [archives][luis-archives] of my site on a more compressive way. 
- [jekyll-include-cache][] - To be able to cache part some includes that repeat themselves in most of the pages. 
- [jemoji][] - The World without emojies is much more boring :man_shrugging:. 
- [kramdown][] - Markdown to HTML converter. 

### Icons + Demo Images:

Some of the icons and images come from the following sites:

- [The Noun Project][TheNounProject] - Icons for everything. 
- [Font Awesome][FontAwesome] - Vector icons and social logos.
- [Unsplash][] - Free images. 

### Other:

I use the additional services, snippets and JavaScript in this site. 

- [Algolia][] - I use their service on this site for searching and indexing the site. 
- [Jekyl Codex][JekylCodex] - I've used some snippets of code from this site for some solutions. Like for example open in a new window when you click in a link to a outside page. 
- [jQuery][] - jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.
- [Susy][] - Susy is a lightweight grid-layout engine for Sass. 
- [Breakpoint][] - Breakpoint makes writing media queries in Sass simpler. 
- [Magnific Popup][MagnificPopup] - Responsive lightbox for images. 
- [FitVids.JS][] - Plugin for fluid width video embeds. 
- [GreedyNav.js][] - JS to handle the burger :hamburger: menu. 
- [Smooth Scroll][SmoothScroll] - A lightweight script to animate scrolling to anchor links.
- [Gumshoe][] - A simple vanilla JS scrollspy script.
- [jQuery throttle / debounce][JqueryThrottle/Debounce] - Allows you to rate-limit your functions in multiple useful ways.
- [Lunr][] - In site search engine
- [Bigfootjs][] - A better way to handle footnotes. 

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md][] for details about the code of conduct, and the process of submitting a pull request to this repo. 

I more than happy to accept contributions to the code and even more to the content —like for example if you encounter a typo or something like that or you are a native English speaker and something you're reading isn't quite right. Even more if you think there is a mistake somewhere.

Please contribute.  

## Versioning

I don't use any versioning system —and I don't know if it's appropriate for a project like a blog— and in general I follow the versioning system used for the [Minimal Mistakes][mmistakes-template] template, which is [SemVer][]. You can check the available versions taking a look to the [tags on this repository][repo-tags].
