This is the readme of my Jekyll page. That I moved from Wordpress to Jekyll while keeping the basic structure and trying to improve the design.

I've used as a base [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) template created by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com). 

This is mainly a work in progress right now so expect some things being odd or not in place. You can check what I want to do in my [issues](https://github.com/luispuerto/luispuerto.net/issues). 

I would be really happy if my work can help others also to change their website. 

PS/ I've archived **my work** in this repo previous to 27^th^ of October 2018 [here](https://github.com/luispuerto/luispuerto.net.back). More info about **why?**Â in this [blog post](http://luispuerto.net/blog/2018/11/05/cutting-down-the-size-of-your-repo/).
